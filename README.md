# CPS-FCore
<p>This repository is mainly used to implement a CPS driver for a self-defined simple language, and the algorithm is described in this paper<a> http://www.brics.dk/RS/01/49/BRICS-RS-01-49.pdf</a></p>

<p>This repository also implements a CPS transformation for SystemF according to the algorithm described in Paper: <a>https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~dpw/papers/tal-toplas.pdf</a></p>
<p>The typed CPS Transformation version is a part of HKU FCore and here is the link. <a> https://github.com/hkuplg/fcore </a> </p>
